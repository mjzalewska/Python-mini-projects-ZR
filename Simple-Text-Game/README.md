# SIMPLE TEXT GAME

### A short console RPG game coded in Python.

The game is set in a fantasy world. 
Players can choose one of the three characters typical for this genre:
an elf, a mage or a knight.
Each character has a set of stats and a weapon type unique to their race.
To pass to the next scene the character needs to either retrieve a particular item
or defeat an enemy.
Certain items can increase the characters' stats, which will return to the 
initial values if the item is disposed of.

The players can interact with the game using the following game menu options:<br />

  "M": "MAIN MENU",<br />
  "D": "DESCRIBE SCENE",<br />
  "B": "SHOW INVENTORY/ BACKPACK",<br />
  "S": "SHOW CHARACTER STATS",<br />
  "E": "SHOW ENEMY STATS",<br />
  "F": "FIGHT ENEMY",<br />
  "R": "RUN",<br />
  "I": "SHOW ITEM STATS",<br />
  "T": "TAKE ITEM",<br />
  "L": "DROP/LEAVE ITEM",<br />
  "U": "USE ITEM",<br />
  "Q": "QUIT GAME"<br />

Requirements: the game utilises standard Python library.
